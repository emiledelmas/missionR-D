# Montpellier Town Hall Traffic Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the flow of visitors at the Montpellier town hall using machine learning techniques. The objective is to forecast both the overall number of spontaneous visitors and the average waiting time per service each week. This allows the town hall to better plan and allocate resources, improving both service efficiency and visitor satisfaction.

## Files
- **`pipeline.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the machine learning pipeline for predicting visitor traffic.
- **`pipeline2.ipynb`**: JJupyter notebook containing the machine learning pipeline for predicting waiting times.
- **`showWeekHeatMap.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook used to visualize weekly visitor trends and predict heat maps.
- **`weather.py`**: Python script for collecting and processing weather data, which is a significant factor affecting visitor numbers.

## Project Context
This project was commissioned by ESII, a company specializing in reception management systems, in collaboration with the Montpellier town hall. The project uses historical data provided by ESII and focuses on utilizing machine learning models to predict visitor traffic and waiting times based on time series analysis.
